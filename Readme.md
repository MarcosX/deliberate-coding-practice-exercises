# Deliberate coding practice

You know you are improving your skills everyday, right? You learn something new, improve skills you already have, tackle more complex problems and ultimately become a better person. But sometimes that is not enough. You need to see progress, even though you feel it, and that is when (Deliberate Practice)[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.PDF] comes into play.

This repo contais a list of exercises you can use to deliberately practice programming. The goal is provide you with exercises where you can have a clear objective and easy way to get feedback, so you can repeat it and keep improving on the skill.

## Exercises framework

To use Deliberate Practice you need to do more than just use you skills, you need to understand the essence of you skill and why you want to improve it, what to improve, get feedback fast and repeat trying to improve based on the feedback you got!

All exercises will provide you with:

* Skill focus: what skill will be exercised
* Constraint/stretch: how the exercise will push your current limits
* Feedback: understand how you have improved

Given the contraint/strech that the exercise will provide it probably will not mean that you should follow it all the time on all code you write.

So pick an exercise and give it a try!

## Contributing

### New exercises

Create a new folder dedicated to the exercise you will suggest and add a Readme.md file in there explaining the exercise, ideally following the framework defined above. If you have any other resources, like code samples, images etc. add them in the same folder.

### Existing exercises

Open a PR with your suggestions and reference the person who submitted the original exercise so she can provide you with a better feedback.
